The python program student_file_creator.py is needed only for testing perposes. BECAREFUL if you run the program, your original file it will be transfered  in the backups folder with a date at the end of its name. 

Settings for student_file_creator.py are give inside the script.Typical values are the following:

students_number = 99
male_proportion = 0.4
special_needs_proportion = 0.2
with_id_proportion = 0.25

old_chools =['OSC1', 'OSC2', 'OSC3']
grades = [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]

----------------------- 

The program classrooms_group_analyzer.py is the main program of the system.
We have the following characteristics

    iterations = 2000
    file_path = 'new_students.xlsx'
    sheet_name = 'Students'
    output_file_path = 'new_students_output.xlsx'

    classrooms = 4

#characteristics = 4  and we want to see how to change them



189    print("Minimum Solution Cost", previous_solution_cost, "was found at iteration", min_iteration, "out of", iterations, "iterations")


analyze_groups shows the males, females etc of the school
create_classrooms: initialize them
place_group_in_classroom:  increase the sizes and append the group in classroom_content
placement_of_groups_in_classrooms: for each group checks to find the more hungry classroom and put the group there.
optimize_classroom_placement: it takes a given number of iterations and finds the minimum cost of each placement of groups in classrooms.



I have a student_file_reader that reads an excel and creates student object in python with yield.  The sudents are listed in order to keep it in a value.
